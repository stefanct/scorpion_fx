This repository contains various OpenSCAD models suitable as attachments to HP-Velotechnik Scorpion fx trikes.

The top-level files are:

- `bike.scad`: just the (incomplete) model of the trike.
- `beam.scad`: a simple add-on beam to mount a tachometer and smartphone holder attached to the trike's main beam by cable ties.
- `mud_front.scad` and `mud_back.scad`: holders for small lights or the like attached to the front and back of the mud guard struts, respectively.
- `front.scad`: a front light holder fixed to the bottle holder screws on the derailleur beam.
